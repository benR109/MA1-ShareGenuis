<p>One of my favorite sports/ hobbies that i do is skiing, not only becuase i have skied since i was very little and have become a very good skier but also becuase i find the technical side of the sport very interesting and know a lot about skis.

Bellow you will find a breif summary of some of the more common ski brands and what makes each one specail as well as on the gallery page you can find more information and images of each ski brand.</p>
